# Creative AI Shortlist 2025
*Assessment date: 18 Sep 2025*

## Executive Summary
Since June 2025, creative-AI tooling has focused on controllability, live co-creation, and commercial-safe licensing. Diffusion newcomers such as **Flux** and **Midjourney v7** tightened typography and reference controls, while **Adobe Firefly** leaned into brand-ready vectors, and front-end aggregators like **Krea** began routing multiple checkpoints through a unified canvas. Video engines—**Runway Gen-3 Turbo** and **Luma Dream Machine 2**—closed the gap between previz and production with character locking and editable motion paths. Audio leaders **Suno v4** and **ElevenLabs Voice Engine 2025** now output stems and compliance metadata, pairing neatly with **Adobe Enhance Speech 2** for cleanup. **ComfyUI** and **TouchDesigner 2025.20000** anchor customizable workflows that bridge open checkpoints with studio routing, as multimodal copilots (**OpenAI GPT-4o Realtime Studio**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, **Gemini 2.0 Advanced**) orchestrate toolchains in real time. Dataset platforms such as **Scenario 3.0** and **Krea Styles Library** mainstreamed rights-aware finetuning. Ten tools every modern creator should monitor: Flux, Midjourney v7, Adobe Firefly, Runway Gen-3 Turbo, Luma Dream Machine 2, Suno v4, ElevenLabs Voice Engine 2025, ComfyUI, TouchDesigner 2025, Scenario 3.0.
